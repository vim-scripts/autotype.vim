       :align: center



Install
=======

Download from Github_, Or Using Vundle or NeoBundle.

``Bundle 'Rykka/autotype.vim'``


Useage
======


AutoType [source_file]
   Start auto typing source_file into current buffer

   All contents of that source_file will be typed

   You can use ``Ctrl-C`` to stop.

   When source_file is omitted, all autotype file under '&rtp' will
   be found for you.


Advancing Usage
===============

You can define commands and variables in specific tags.

See below.

:WARNING: Behavior of using commands and mappings are **NOT**
          predictable.

          As users may have different settings.

          And as ``AutoType`` can do mostly everything with your vim.

          So run autotype file always with **DOUBLE CHECKING**.


Syntax Overview
---------------

Files with '.autotype' extensions will be recongized as ``autotype`` filetype.

Default syntax is 'jinja' alike, and can be changed. 

vim commands are used directly in these tags.

Try demo with ``:AutoType syntax``.

File is at ``autotype/syntax.autotype``.

Syntax overview::

    Comments
    {# Comments or Multiline Comments 
       Can be used #}

    Command Tag:
    {% ECHO 'GO START' | NORM! 0  | TYPE 'SOMETHING' | NORM! $ %}

    Command Blocks:
    {@
        let a = 10
        " Insert line number for last 10 lines
        exe 'norm! '.a.'k'
        for i in range(a)
            norm! 0
            INSERT 'LINE '.i.' '
            norm! j
        endfor
    @}
    
    Use python code 
    {@ python
    # Aware the indent.
    # You can access local variables with _
    print _['__file__']
    def Hello(name):
        print name

    Hello('World')
    _['__file__'] = 5
    @}
   
    Variable Tag: 

        Local variable:  a = {{ a }}
        Eval {{ range(10) + [1, 2, 3] }}
        Context variable: {{ __file__ }}

    Simple Command Tag: 
    (^_xxx follow with a space or end of line)

    Yank ^_yy

    Paste and go end of line ^_p$

:Warning: 

      **Work With Moving Commands**

      When using moving command like 
      ``{{% norm 0 %}}`` or ``^_0``

      Following lines will be typed **FROM** that position.
      This will make output totally different from autotype source.

      **BUT IT IS THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR**

      *AS THIS IS AN AUTOTYPE ENGINE, NOT A TEMPLATE ENGINE.*

      So you must always take care what is the correct position
      after a moving command. 

      (Luckily, you can test by typing it directly.)


      e.g.:

      An autotype file::

          {# WRONG ONE #}
          THE {% NORM 0 | INSERT 'THIS' %} IS
          CORRECT
          POSITION

      will produce::

          THIS IS
          CORRECT
          POSITIONTHE 

      You need to add a movement back to make it work::

          {# CORRECT ONE #}
          THE {% NORM 0 | INSERT 'THIS' %} IS {% norm $ %}
          CORRECT
          POSITION

      Then this will produce::

          THIS IS THE
          CORRECT
          POSITION

      You can use the simple command tag::

          {# SIMPLE ONE 
             Note: the command will consume one space
              So we must type 2 space here.  #}
          THE ^_0iTHIS  IS ^_$
          CORRECT
          POSITION

      See demo with ``AutoType position``.

      File is at ``autotype/position.autotype``

Variables
---------

Variables are valid in each running context.

You can use 'b:var' or 'g:var' for global variables across 
sources.

See ``autotype/var.autotype`` for a example.

**Context Variables**

There are some predefined context variables.

    __file__
        The file name that running ``AutoType`` command
    __source__
        The autotype source file. 
    __arg__
        Argument passed to ``AutoType``
    __line__
        Executing line
    __lnum__
        Executing line number
    __time__
        Start time
    __exec_time__
        Total executed time (Not avaliable during executing)
    __speed__
        The executing speed

You can set global context variables 
by setting ``g:autotype_global_context``, e.g.::
        
    let g:autotype_global_context = {'__author__': 'AutoType'}

You can get last context with ``g:autotype_last_context``.

Help Commands
-------------

*Commands that can be used both in tags and vim*

NORMAL[!] commands here
    Like ':normal', And words like \<C-W> will be convert 
    to that special character

    Add ``!`` to act as ``:normal!``

    example::

        NORM :ECHO 'Hello '.input('Your name:')\<CR>Auto\<CR>
        " will produce:
        " Hello Auto

APPEND[!] 'text here'
    Append things with current cursor position.
    Act as ``a`` in normal mode

    Add ``!`` and act as ``A``

    example::

        APPEND string(range(4))
        " will append to current line with
        " [0, 1, 2, 3]

INSERT[!] 'text here'
    Insert things with current cursor position.
    Act as ``i`` in normal mode

    Add ``!`` and act as ``I``

    :NOTE: To add to the beginning of line, instead of 
           beginning of line content.

           You should use ``NORM 0`` to move there.

TYPE[!] 'text here'
    Same as ``APPEND``.


[n]ECHO[!] [str/list/dict]
    Echo things like ':echo', And will show for a longer time.


    Add ``!`` to use ``ErrorMsg`` highlight,
    Default is ``ModeMsg`` highlight.

    You can pass a list:
        Then it will echo with each item.

        e.g.::

            ECHO range(10,1,-1) | 1BLINK 'Go!'

    You can pass a dictionary:
        'hl': hightlight. 
        You can set ``g:autotype_default_hl`` for it.

        'char': '[char]' part.
        You can set ``g:autotype_default_char`` for it.

        'arg': str/lst to print

    e.g.::  

        ECHO {'hl':'String','arg':'Hello', 'char': 'Mike'}

    Add ``n`` to wait ``n`` second.
    Default is dynamic by current speed.

    The things echoed will also be shown in ':message'.


    :XXX: A number passed to ``ECHO`` directly can not be shown.

          Like ``:ECHO 3``,
          will produce ``Argument Required Error``

          So use ``ECHO '3'`` 
          or ``ECHO a`` (assume ``a == 3`` )

[n]BLINK[!] [str/list/dict]
    A blinking versoin of ':echo' 

[n]BLINK[!] [str/list/dict]
    A blinking versoin of ':echo' 

:Note: **Bar**

       ``NORM|ECHO|TYPE|APPEND|BLINK|INSERT`` 
       both receives the ``|`` command.

       See ':h :command-bar'

:Note: **Quotes**

       In ``INSERT/APPEND/TYPE/ECHO/BLINK``,

       Strings passed must all using single quote ``'``.
       You can escape it with ``''``.

       In ``INSERT/APPEND``: works as double quoted,

           Then you can use ``\r`` as a return.
           To insert a ``\``, escape as ``\\``

       In ``ECHO/BLINK``: works as single quoted.

       See ':h expr-string'.

:Note: **Special Characters**

        In ``NORMAL``, Trigger special keys using ``\<C-XX>``

        If you met something unexpected with command line input
        action.

        First check if enough ``\<CR>`` are used.

        Then you can try typing raw special charactes there.
        See ``:h i_Ctrl-V`` for details.



INCLUDE source_file[.autotype]
    Include a autotype source file in command tag/block.

    This command can **NOT** be executed as vim command.

    It searches the source file from 
    ``local>g:autotype_file_directory>&rtp``

    See demo with ``AutoType include``.
    File is at ``autotype/include.autotype``

    When files are recursively included, it will run
    only the first time.
    
Options
=======

g:autotype_speed
    Auto typing speed (char per second), range from (1 to more),
    default is ``30``, which is mankind.

    Slow as turtle? use '2'.

    Fast as swift? use '400'.

    Blazing lighting? use '30000' or more.

    You can set it with one of 
    ``turtle,mankind,swift,lighting``,

    Then it's at the relevent speed.

    ``:AtpSpd`` can be used as a quick speed setup.

g:autotype_syntax_type
    Default is 'jinja'.
        1. Command tag is '{% cmds %}'
        2. Variable tag is '{{ var }}'
        3. Comment tag is '{# var #}'
        4. Command block is '{@' and '@}',
           both in single line
        5. Inline Command is ``^_cmds``
        6. To prevent exec of tags, add a '!' before the tag.

    Then the 'autotype'
        1. Command tag is '^[ cmds ^]'
        2. Comment tag is '^< var ^>'
        3. Variable tag is '^{ var ^}'
        4. Command block is '^[^[' and '^]^]',
           both in single line
        5. Inline Command is ``^_cmds``

    You can define your own tag syntax if needed.
    Following list of options can be changed::
        
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmd_bgn",  '{%'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmd_end",  '%}'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmds_bgn", '{@'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmds_end", '@}'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmt_bgn",  '{#'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmt_end",  '#}'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_var_bgn",  '{{'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_var_end",  '}}'],
            ["g:autotype_syn_cmd_once", '^_'],

    :NOTE: ``g:autotype_syntax_type`` **SHOULD** be set
            with a name other than 'jinja' or 'autotype'

            And these options should be a pattern for matching.

            e.g: '^' should be escaped as ``'\^'``

            See ':h pattern-atoms' for details

g:autotype_file_directory
    The user directory for your autotype source files.

    Default is ``''``.

    The ``:AutoType source_file`` will search file in current dir,
    then in this path and the ``&rtp/autotype/`` directory
    for all '\*.autotype' file to match the filename.

    You can add multiple paths seperated with comma ','.

g:autotype_global_context
    You can predefine variable in context.

    e.g.::
        
        let g:autotype_global_context = {'__author__': 'AutoType'}

    See Variables_ for context details.


g:autotype_cursor_aug
    Used for running autocommands with ``CursorMoved``

    Set ``aug_ptn`` seperate with ``,``

    Default is ``'*.rst,<buffer>'``

    This is mainly used for updating buffer with InstantRst_

g:autotype_default_char 
    The '[char]' part for ``ECHO|BLINK``

g:autotype_default_hl
    The '[char]' part's highlight for ``ECHO|BLINK``

ISSUES
======

Post issues at github_

You can contribute to them as well.

Currently, there are some issues around.
        
    1. Typing ``'`` with some text will cause the text to reindent.

       This is caused mainly by indent settings
       like '&inde,&indk,&cpo'.
       So you should check them first.
